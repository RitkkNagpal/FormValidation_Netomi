What is form validation?
Go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice that they provide feedback when you don't enter your data in the format they are expecting. You'll get messages such as:

"This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).
"Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data format is required for it to be considered valid).
"Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).
"Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number." (A very specific data format is required for your data).
This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application.
